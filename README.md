This is the repo of the AI Financial Analyst app, which is basically a Google Gemini 1.5 powered LLM RAG Application which provides Key Insights and to users about Companies, based on their 10K Report filings. For demonstration purposes, I have considered only the 5 latest 10K filings for each of the three companies. Moreover, the app also provides users with the ability to chat with the documents and ask the llm about any query on the 10k reports. 

## **App structure**

Upon Starting the app, the users are first greeted with a sidebar on the left where they can choose the company of their choice, and also if they want to get the key insights and sentiment analysis of the company, want to ask questions regarding the 10K filings. 

On clicking the submit and process button after selecting the company, the 10K files for the companies are loaded and processed. The App then displays the "Key Insights" and various other Key Metrics and analysis of the company as follows:

All the data are displayed under expandable text areas, which the user can then bring down and view. As per their choice. 

If the users, want to ask any questions based on the reports, the users can click on **User Queries** on the left side bar, and ask their queries in the chat area:

The insights I highlighted are crucial for investors because they provide a comprehensive understanding of a company's financial health, performance, and future prospects. Here's why each area is significant:

**1. Financial Performance & Trends:**
  **Predicting Future Performance:** Understanding historical and current financial performance helps investors predict future earnings, cash flows, and growth potential.
  **Evaluating Management Effectiveness:** Analyzing trends in revenue, profitability, and EPS reveals how effectively management utilizes resources and generates returns.
  **Assessing Investment Risk:** Financial performance metrics like debt levels and cash flow help evaluate the company's financial risk and ability to withstand economic   
                                 downturns.
**2. Financial Position & Risk:**
  **Gauging Financial Stability:** Analyzing debt, liquidity, and working capital management reveals the company's financial stability and ability to meet its obligations.
  **Understanding Financial Leverage:** Assessing debt levels helps investors understand the company's financial risk and its potential impact on earnings and cash flow.
  **Identifying Potential Threats:** Contingencies and commitments can pose significant financial risks, and investors need to be aware of their potential impact.                                
**3. Business Segments & Operations:**
  **Evaluating Diversification:** Understanding the performance of different business segments helps investors assess the company's diversification and its impact on risk 
                                  and growth.
  **Assessing Competitive Advantage:** Analyzing the competitive landscape reveals the company's strengths and weaknesses relative to its peers and potential threats to its 
                                  market position.
**Understanding Innovation & Growth Potential:** R&D spending is an indicator of the company's commitment to innovation and its potential for future growth.  

**4. Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A):**
  **Gaining Management's Perspective:** MD&A provides valuable insights into management's strategy, outlook, and assessment of key risks and opportunities.
  **Understanding Industry Dynamics:** MD&A often discusses industry trends, challenges, and the company's competitive positioning within the industry.
  **Assessing Future Plans:** MD&A reveals the company's strategic initiatives and plans for future growth and value creation.

The "Key insights" provide, users with the overall overview of the company's performance based on the analysis of all the filed 10K records, and the "Sentiment Analysis" performs an Over all sentiment analysis of the text in the reports. 

## **Choice of TechStack**
This is an app which analyzes the 10K filings of the companies and provides some Valuable insights on them, Additionally i also made it into a RAG application, so that users can also chat with the documents with the help of the LLM API. I largely coded the app on python because of its versatility, readability, and extensive ecosystem of libraries for data science, machine learning, and natural language processing tasks.The other tech stacks which i used were: 

 **1) Streamlit:**
    **Rationale:** Streamlit is a Python library that simplifies the creation of interactive web applications, making it easy to build user interfaces. 
 **2) PyPDF2:**
    **Rationale:** PyPDF2 is a Python library used for extracting text and metadata from PDF files, which is essential for processing the 10K reports and converting them 
      into a format suitable for analysis.
**3) LangChain:**
  **Rationale:** LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for text splitting, 
    embedding, vector stores, and chain creation, streamlining the process of building a RAG application.
**4) Google Generative AI (GenAI):**
  **Rationale:** GenAI offers powerful LLMs and embedding models that are used for understanding and generating text, forming the core of the question-answering and insight 
    extraction capabilities of the application.
 **5) FAISS:**
  **Rationale:** FAISS is an efficient library for similarity search, enabling the application to find relevant sections of the 10K report that are most likely to contain 
    answers to user queries or insights related to specific aspects of the company's financials.
**6) Concurrent.Futures:**
  **Rationale:** This Python module enables parallel processing, allowing the application to extract text and process PDFs concurrently, thereby significantly reducing the 
    overall processing time.
